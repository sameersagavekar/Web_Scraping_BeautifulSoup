# Web_Scraping_BeautifulSoup
I am going to visit https://www.airlinequality.com as we can see that there is a lot of data there. For this task, we are only interested in reviews related to Air India. I am goming to use Python and BeautifulSoup to collect all the links to the reviews and then to collect the text data on each of the individual review links.
